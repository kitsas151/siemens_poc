2. 
Write a program that calculates the sum of squares of
 elements in a given vector using a lambda expression 
 with std::accumulate.

3.
Write a program that takes a vector of integers and filters out
 the odd numbers using std::copy_if with a lambda expression.

 4.
 Write a program that filters out components from a vector based
  on a condition using std::remove_if with a lambda expression.

  5.
  mplement a custom algorithm using lambda expressions, such as
   finding the maximum element, counting occurrences of a
    value, or finding the average of elements in a vector.

Questions on auto.

1.
Declare a variable using auto and initialize it with an
 integer value.
Declare another variable using auto and initialize it with
 a floating-point value.
Print both variables to verify that their types 
were correctly inferred.

2.
Create an array of Devices where 
deviceid int ,name string, location string  and
 status is bool.
Use a range-based for loop with auto to iterate over the
 elements of the array.
Print each element.

3.
Write a function that takes two integers as input and returns
 their sum.
Use auto as the return type for this function.
Call the function and print the result.

4.
Write code that creates a reference to a variable and
uses auto to deduce the reference type.
prove the difference  between auto and auto&.

5.
Write code that creates a pointer to a variable and
uses auto to deduce the pointer type.
Explore the difference between auto* and auto with a
pointer literal.





   /*

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int value = 42;

  // auto deduces a reference type (int&)
  auto ref = value;

  // auto& directly creates a reference
  auto& ref2 = value;

  std::cout << "Type of ref: " << typeid(ref).name() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Type of ref2: " << typeid(ref2).name() << std::endl;

  // Modifying through ref modifies the original value
  ref = 100;
  std::cout << "value after modifying ref: " << value << std::endl;

  // Modifying through ref2 modifies the original value (same as ref)
  ref2 = 200;
  std::cout << "value after modifying ref2: " << value << std::endl;

  return 0;
}


#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int value = 42;

  // auto deduces a pointer type (int*)
  auto ptr = &value;

  // auto with a pointer literal creates an int* (not a reference)
  auto ptr2 = new int(100); // Dynamically allocated memory

  std::cout << "Type of ptr: " << typeid(ptr).name() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Type of ptr2: " << typeid(ptr2).name() << std::endl;

  // Modifying through ptr modifies the original value
  *ptr = 200;
  std::cout << "value after modifying through ptr: " << value << std::endl;

  // Modifying through ptr2 modifies the allocated memory (not value)
  *ptr2 = 300;
  std::cout << "*ptr2 after modification: " << *ptr2 << std::endl;
  std::cout << "value after modifying ptr2 (not affected): " << value << std::endl;

  // Remember to deallocate memory using delete
  delete ptr2;

  return 0;
}

auto ptr = &value;
auto deduces the type of the address-of operator (&value) which is a pointer to int (int*). This points to the memory location of value.
auto ptr2 = new int(100);
auto with a new expression creates a pointer to the
 allocated memory. Here, it allocates memory for an int
  with the value 100 and ptr2 becomes a pointer to that
   memory (int*). 
   
   It's important to note that this creates a new variable in
    memory, not a reference to value.
