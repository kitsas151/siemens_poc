1. lambda expression..

1. capture the environment 
2. practically.... we can define the function and assign
to some other function..
3. treat an object like a function, functor.

Templates .. generic programming..

template.. we are making the code data type independent..

code...

1. template function
2. template class.

whenever see a template function or a class. we are not seeing one thing.
we are seeing a family of functions or family of classes.

how template is instantiated..

int *p =?
? is a int variable usually.

Base *b = ?
? need not be base class object, it can be a derived class object also..

we  will join back in 15 minutes time.

1. in your logic think where you can apply generic programming.
2. Template --  class, function
3. template specialization, why are we doing that..
4. template instantiated.. 
4.1 when we use the template
calling of function
or creating the object of the class
explicit template instantiation.  
5.i want my template function to take variable number of inputs.
variadic temple
parameter packs  -- input
6. we are taking some inputs for the template do we put some constraints
in terms of the data type..
template<typename X> // X to be data type which is related to numbers.
int, float. double but not  a string
