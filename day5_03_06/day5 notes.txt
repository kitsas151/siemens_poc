templates.
1.generic code
2. specialization
3. instantiation
4. you can have a template that can take n number of arguments.
5. can we put some constraints on the template types.


treat different things in a standardized way... == means we need to use interfaces.

freak point

1. abstract class  --is a base class, construcors, non static members
2. interface  --not a class --no member variales, no constructor

if we cannot create an object of the abstract class.
who will call the constructors and non static functions of the abstract class.
derived class object

decltype.

1. if we are doing templae programming and we dont know the type of the expression.
then we can use decltype to tell the compiler hey you deduce the type..


variadic template..

1. you have n number of arguments...
2. once you pick each argument then you can use the decltype..


auto is to deduce the type look at the usage. prefer to use with decltype.
auto, I dont care for the type.. using with STL



common project scenario

1. I am doing X , X needs Y and I dont know Y.
best way to forget X is doing phd on Y

decltype..
forward..

lreference
rreference --c++  11

lvalue
rvalue.

int i =3;
4=i;
4 is rvalue



context.
1. templates decltype.  --X

Y
 int &&i =3;
r reference..


template function whose input argument is reference.

template<typename x>
void f1(X &&y)


int k =4;
int &m =k;
f1(m);
f1(3);




decltype prove you need its usage.


1. what is lrefrence and what is rrefernce.
2. we have functions overloaded to take lreference or rreference.
3. we have a templatized function whose input argument can be lreference or rreference.
4. then we have  problem inside this templatized function.. it is not able to differentiate.
5. how to differentiate.. ok think of using std::forward, what happens.
6. ok because of 5 lreference is lreference and rreference is rrefernce.


take a break till 11.20AM..


const int &a=3;

	

20 minutes  -- 11.45AM

0. day3\a01template folder...a09reference to a16inheritance programs see are you able to understand
1. in calculator use decltype and see what it does for you.
2. copy paste 3 examples on decltype from google and see whether it was worth using decltype or not.
3. code base look where any decltype is used or not.

--------------------------------

inheritance...

0. by creating a devied class object
1. we want to call the base class , function derived class function
2. inside the derived class you want to call the base class function.
you need some differentiating factor, one simple way is using this.

----------------------

if we want to call the

1. base class parametrized constructor
2. during derived class object creation
3. we need to do it explicitly by calling the base class parametrized constructor in the derived class constructor.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Delegating constructor.

1. we have a class called X
2. in class X we have many constructors, because project needs it.. constructor is overloaded.
3. we want to call one constructor from the other constructor on the same object.


class A
{
A():A(0) {   }
A(int i)  {  }

}

A obj;



class Rct
Rct() call deleating constructor  {}
Rct(int l) calling constructor  {}


Rct(int l,int b)   -- delegating constructor
{	

write some logic for taking l, b ..

}


unfortunate fate today is copy paste features from one language to another and change its name..

override 
we use this in the derived class.
to check the function we have defined is overridden or not

override.
1. used in the derived class
2. if the function is not present in the base class, it will show a compilation error.


final
1. with respect to class, it means it can no longer be a base class.
2. with respect to function, function cannot be overridden.



if we tell inheritance, telling derived class object cannot access base class functions is a  sin.



Nested classes.
1. prove its need.
X cannot exist until Y exists..
that means nest X under Y.

X=iterator, Cursor,Thread,Pair
Y=container,Window,Process,Map



vector<string>::iterator it;
it is an object of the class iterator which is nested under Vector class.

uniformintializer.
1 we want to have a consistant way of initialzing different category of variables,, int, class type, array.

class ? classname

?
1. Microsoft specific documentation mentions
2. c++ compiler which is some embedded some specific implementation..

gnu g++ implementation..


template<typename T, typename U> 
auto add(T t, U u) -> decltype(t + u) 

1. add is the functionname.
2. its input argument is of type T and U, T and U are different data types.
the logic we are doing inside is adding two different data types..
int +float
double +float
3.we are definer of add function.
4. somebody else could be the caller of the add function.
5. this caller will have no clue what auto means because usually he will not see the body of the function.
6. ->decltype(t+u)

we are telling the caller hey look
you know your T
you know your U
return type of this function will be result of t+u

double x= add(2,3.3);































// return type depends on template parameters // return type can be deduced since C++14 { return t + u; }
